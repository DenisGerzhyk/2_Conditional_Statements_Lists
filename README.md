# 2_Conditional_Statements_Lists
1).
This code takes two input integers from the user and then prompts the user to enter an arithmetic operator (+, -, *, or /). The code then uses a conditional statement to perform the appropriate operation on the two input integers, depending on which operator was entered by the user. The result of the operation is then printed to the console.

2).
This code initializes a list "a" with some integer values. It then provides two different ways to move the last element of the list to the front of the list. In the first way, it first checks if the list is empty. If it is not empty, it initializes a new list "b" with the last element of "a". It then concatenates "b" and "a" to form a new list "c", and removes the last element of "c" using the del keyword. Finally, it prints "c". In the second way, it pops the last element of "a" and assigns it to a new list "b". It then concatenates "b" and "a" to form a new list "c", and prints "c".

3).
This code initializes an empty list "a". It then checks if the length of the list is even or odd, and assigns the value of the index of the middle element to the variable "middle". It then splits the list into two separate lists "first" and "second", where "first" contains the elements from the beginning of the list up to (but not including) the middle index, and "second" contains the elements from the middle index to the end of the list. It then creates a new list that contains both "first" and "second" as separate lists, and prints the result.
